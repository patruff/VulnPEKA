The authentication of clients of earlier versions of SNMP is performed only by a ""community string"", in effect a type of password, which is transmitted in cleartext. 
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has designated SNMPv3 a full Internet standard, the highest maturity level for an RFC. It considers earlier versions to be obsolete designating them (""Historic""). (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3410.txt)","The system is at high risk of being exposed to security vulnerabilities. Since the vendor no longer provides updates, obsolete software is more vulnerable to viruses and other attacks.","Disable or remove SNMPv1/2c authentication. Use SNMP version 3 authentication 
SNMPv3 provides additional security features: 
Confidentiality - Encryption of packets to prevent snooping by an unauthorized source. 
Integrity - Message integrity to ensure that a packet has not been tampered with in transit including an optional packet replay protection mechanism. 
Authentication - to verify that the message is from a valid source.  
For IBM AIX users the following document is recommended  SNMP for network management (http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.networkcomm/snmp_intro.htm) 














Workaround:

 1) How to disable for Apache: 
 Typically, for Apache/mod_ssl, httpd.conf or ssl.conf should have the following lines: 
SSLProtocol -ALL +SSLv3 +TLSv1 
SSLCipherSuite ALL:!aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM  
For Apache/apache_ssl include the following line in the configuration file (httpsd.conf): 
SSLRequireCipher ALL:!aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM 
  2) IIS: 
 For IIS please see: How to disable PCT 1.0, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, or TLS 1.0 in Internet Information Services (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/187498/en-us), How to Restrict the Use of Certain Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols in Schannel.dll (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245030/en-us), How to Determine the Cipher Suite for the Server and Client (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299520/en-us), , and How to restrict the use of certain ciphers in Internet Information Services 5.0 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/241447)

 1) How to disable for Apache: 
 Typically, for Apache/mod_ssl, httpd.conf or ssl.conf should have the following lines: 
SSLProtocol -ALL +SSLv3 +TLSv1 
SSLCipherSuite ALL:!aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM  
For Apache/apache_ssl include the following line in the configuration file (httpsd.conf): 
SSLRequireCipher ALL:!aNULL:!ADH:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM 
  2) IIS: 
 For IIS please see: How to disable PCT 1.0, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, or TLS 1.0 in Internet Information Services (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/187498/en-us), How to Restrict the Use of Certain Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols in Schannel.dll (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245030/en-us), How to Determine the Cipher Suite for the Server and Client (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299520/en-us), , and How to restrict the use of certain ciphers in Internet Information Services 5.0 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/241447)
 
 3) Wu-FTP: 
For Wu-FTP which supports TLS, the ciphers parameter in TLS configuration file should be set to -ALL +SSLv3 +TLSv1  For more details please consult the docs/HOWTO/ssl_and_tls_ftpd.HOWTO  file provided by wu-ftpd distribution.
 
 4) Lighttpd: 
For lighttpd: Locate the lighttpd config file and modify the following  ssl.ciper-list line to include !aNULL.  A restart of the lightttpd application is necessary. 
Example: ssl.cipher-list = ""TLSv1+HIGH !SSLv2 RC4+MEDIUM !aNULL !eNULL !3DES @STRENGTH""
